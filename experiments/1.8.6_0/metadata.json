    "readme": "Any autoregressive-like model needs a starting point to make predictions. Normally, one might use the control expression. Certain benchmarks, such as DCD-FG figure 5, instead feed in the heldout-data and allow each gene to be predicted as a function of heldout expression of other genes. This is necessary to e.g. compute the DCD-FG likelihood. How much difference does this make?",
